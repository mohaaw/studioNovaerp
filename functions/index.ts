/**
 * CONCEPTUAL CLOUD FUNCTIONS for NovaX ERP
 * 
 * This file outlines the conceptual backend logic that would power the advanced features of NovaX ERP.
 * These functions would be deployed to Firebase Cloud Functions.
 */

// --- Cosmic Insights (AI Recommendations) ---
/**
 * onNewTransaction:
 * - Trigger: Firestore (onCreate /transactions/{transactionId})
 * - Action: Analyzes the new transaction (e.g., a large sale, a low stock movement).
 * - Logic: Feeds data into a Genkit AI model to generate a "Cosmic Insight". 
 *          For example, "Sales velocity for Product X has increased by 30% this week. Consider reordering."
 * - Output: Writes the new insight to the `cosmic_insights` collection.
 */

// --- Prophecy Pricing & Discounting ---
/**
 * calculateDynamicPrice:
 * - Trigger: HTTP (callable from the frontend)
 * - Input: productId, customerId, quantity
 * - Logic: 1. Fetches current market data, competitor pricing (from external APIs), and customer history.
 *          2. Uses a Genkit model to determine the optimal price or a special discount.
 * - Output: Returns the calculated price to the frontend.
 */

// --- Neural Network Automation Engine ---
/**
 * onSalesOrderCreate:
 * - Trigger: Firestore (onCreate /transactions/{transactionId} where type == 'sales')
 * - Logic: 1. Checks if the sales order matches any pre-defined automation rules in `automation_workflows`.
 *          2. If a match is found (e.g., "If order > $10,000 and customer is VIP"), it executes a series of actions.
 *          3. Actions could include: sending a notification to the account manager, creating a task in the project module,
 *             or sending a special thank you email.
 * - Output: Performs the defined actions (e.g., creates new Firestore documents, sends emails).
 */

// --- Hyper-Secure Blockchain Ledger ---
/**
 * logToLedger:
 * - Trigger: HTTP (callable from the frontend for critical actions)
 * - Input: actionDescription, user, timestamp
 * - Logic: 1. Validates that the user has 'Admin' privileges.
 *          2. Creates a new block with the action details.
 *          3. Calculates the hash of the new block, including the hash of the previous block to form a chain.
 * - Output: Writes the new, immutable block to the `blockchain_ledger` collection.
 */
 
// --- Interstellar Compliance Guardian ---
/**
 * dailyComplianceCheck:
 * - Trigger: Pub/Sub (scheduled to run daily)
 * - Logic: 1. Iterates through relevant data (e.g., financial transactions).
 *          2. Compares data against rules defined in the `compliance_rules` collection.
 *          3. If a potential violation is found, an alert is created.
 * - Output: Creates a new document in a `compliance_alerts` collection.
